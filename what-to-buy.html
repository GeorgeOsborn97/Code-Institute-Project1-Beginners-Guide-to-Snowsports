                 <h3>The Equipment List</h3>
                 <p>
                  So hopefully by now you are thinking that you are ready to crack on and get started, the last thing we are going to need to do it kit you out. Now to getting fully kitted out for a ski trip can get really quite expensive, so here i'm going to break down the bare essentials, give you advice on where and when to buy, whats worth spending that bit more on, and hopefully not break the bank.

                <h3>Essentials</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><details><summary><strong>A good pair of salopettes:</strong></summary> Now these are the one thing I would reccomend putting a bit more money towards a good paor of salopettes will last years and the last thing you want is a tear or poor waterproofing. Salopettes will be your best friend on the mountain so treat them well. A good high end pair can run you up above £200, but if you look for end of season sales you can easily get that down to between £100-£150 for a good pair. But if that is still a bit steap Decathlon has a great range of cheaper Salopettes that will certailnly do for your first time on the hill.</details></li>
                    <li><details><summary><strong>Warm waterproof jacket:</strong></summary> A lot of people will say the same about a jacket as i just said about salopettes, however if you are just learning in the snowdome, and thinking of heading out in early spring you do not need a really expensive jacket, you@ll spend more time with it off then on. Obviously if you rae heading to Scandanivia, Canada or peak season in the Alps get a warm coat. but as beginners you'll likely be pre or post peak season when its a bit warmer. and you wont be heading straight for the top of the mountain. so i'd recommend getting something waterproof, good in teh wind and relatively lightweight so that you can take it off when you get warm and odds are put it back on when getting on the lifts. again Decathlon are great for cheap options but most Mountain/outdoor stores will sell decent jackets so keep an eye out for sales.</details></li>
                    <li><details><summary><strong>A good pair of gloves:</strong></summary> why, how much</details></li>
                    <li><details><summary><strong>Decent socks:</strong></summary> why, how much</details></li>
                    <li><details><summary><strong>Base layer:</strong></summary> why, how much</details></li>
