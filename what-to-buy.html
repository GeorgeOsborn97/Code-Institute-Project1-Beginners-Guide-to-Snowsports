                 <p>
                  So hopefully by now you are thinking that you are ready to crack on and get started, the last thing we are going to need to do it kit you out. Now to getting fully kitted out for a ski trip can get really quite expensive, so here I'm going to break down the bare essentials and hopefully not break the bank.

                <!--A list with clapsable list items that explains the reason why these items are neccesary and how much they cost -->
                <h3>Essentials</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><details><summary><strong>A good pair of salopettes:</strong></summary> Now these are the one thing I would reccomend putting a bit more money towards a good paor of salopettes will last years and the last thing you want is a tear or poor waterproofing. Salopettes will be your best friend on the mountain so treat them well. A good high end pair can run you up above £200, but if you look for end of season sales you can easily get that down to between £100-£150 for a good pair. But if that is still a bit steap Decathlon has a great range of cheaper Salopettes that will certailnly do for your first time on the hill.</details></li>
                    <li><details><summary><strong>Warm waterproof jacket:</strong></summary> A lot of people will say the same about a jacket as i just said about salopettes, however if you are just learning in the snowdome, and thinking of heading out in early spring you do not need a really expensive jacket, you@ll spend more time with it off then on. Obviously if you rae heading to Scandanivia, Canada or peak season in the Alps get a warm coat. but as beginners you'll likely be pre or post peak season when its a bit warmer. and you wont be heading straight for the top of the mountain. so i'd recommend getting something waterproof, good in teh wind and relatively lightweight so that you can take it off when you get warm and odds are put it back on when getting on the lifts. again Decathlon are great for cheap options but most Mountain/outdoor stores will sell decent jackets so keep an eye out for sales.</details></li>
                    <li><details><summary><strong>A good pair of gloves:</strong></summary> Gloves are one of things things that can be more expensive then people realise, you may also be tempted to buy inner gloves which again unless your are hedaing really far North they are not needed. I will also say that the best gloves I have ever owned were a £10 pair from Decathalon, dont get sucked in by high price = good qualty. Finally I would recommend mittens over Gloves, they are warmer and easier to slip on and off if you need to access a pocket.</details></li>
                    <li><details><summary><strong>Decent socks:</strong></summary> Every shop will try to sell you padded ski socks, they'll give you a whole speach about how great they are and don't get me wrong I've owned some amazing pairs that were so comfy, but for £40 they are not necaserilly worth it. a good pair of hiking socks will do exactly the same for half the money. At the end of the day the main things are warmth and making sure they fit in your boot without leaving space or crushing your toes. Don't get sucked in to buy overly expensive "specialised socks."</details></li>
                    <li><details><summary><strong>Base layer:</strong></summary> I will always recommend bring at least 2 sets of base layers. Again if you are going somewhere very cold bring more, and be preppared to spend a bit more. For the Alps I usually wear a thin legging under my salopettes and a thin thermal top under my coat and I'm happy. most clothing stores will sell thermal base layers. M&S used to do some really good ones but I'm not sure if they still do, other shops such as mountain warehouse are very good for this kind of thing. Some people will wear a thin jumper as a middle layer above a base layer, this is down to personal prefrence, I find I get too hot like that but if you get cold easily I would recommend you do this. At least bring one out so you have it if you need it.</details></li>

                <h3>Rent or Buy?</h3>
                <p>This may be phrased as a question but it didn't need to be... Rent. And after a couple of years then buy. People dream of owning their own ski's or their own board but don't rush to buy very expensive equipment. Firstly find what area of the mountain you enjoy, see what kind of board or skis fit your riding style. Take the time and when you know what you want, buy. The thing that is worth getting earlier are boots. If you have falling in love with the sport and are going to be going every year, get yourself a good pair of fitted boots. your own boots are so much more important than your own board or pair of ski's.</p>
                <details>
                  <summary><strong>Rent</strong></summary>
                  <p>Typical Rentals for boots and ski's/boards will run up to around £100-£150 per week. Most base packages may be less down to around £80 and even less for kids. When learning just get the base packages where ever you go, you aren't going to be worried about directional boards or twin tips, the difference between camber and rocker and what kind of flex you need.
                      As you start to improve and are heading into more advanced lessons and learning to explore the mountain on your own maybe look to upgrading your rental. Almost all rental shops will have an advanced section that have ski's and boards for various diffrenet situations that you can personally fine tune. And this is what I mean when I said don't buy straight away. use these services to learn what you like and then you can make an informed decision on what kind of equipment you need. Rentals have one big floor though and thats the boots, one trip you may get lucky and get a fantastic pair, another you are stuck with boots that just don't fit correctly. which is also why I recommend buying boots much earlier.

                  <summary><strong>Buy</strong></summary>
                  <p>If you are looking to buy here are just a few of my personal recommendations, for me Vans snowboard boots are 10/10. my first pair were vans and they lasted me 3 full seasons, other than Vans a common go to is Burton, I have never owned burton but they are the biggest brand for a reason you cant really go wrong. on a personal note from me I go laces over boas every time. that just my prefernce. Ski boots I don't know all too well but from people I know Salomon is always a good bet. friends and family have bought Salomon ski boots and swear by them.<br>
                  In terms of boards and ski's again i know one much better the=an the other. for a first board if you are looking i would highly recommend looking at Jones, and specfically the Mounatin twin its an exceptional board that will be comfortable all over the mounatin. Again ski wise Salomon make some really good ski's the other brand that is very popular is K2. In terms of ski bindings I would have a look at whats recommended with the specific ski you hace choosen. but in terms of boards i would highly recommend NOW bindings, again they have worked for me for many years and I buy NOW every time.</p>
