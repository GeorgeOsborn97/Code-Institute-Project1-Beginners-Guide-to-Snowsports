### What I wanted to achieve:

1. Each user should come away from the website having learned something new about the world of snowsports.

2. If the user has a specific question that is not answered they will have the ability to ask their question.

3. The information provided is formatted in a clear and consistant way.

4. The website provokes a positive response through its imagary and formatting

5. The style of the website is consistant throughout all pages.

6. Responsive design allows the site to be easily viewed across multiple devices.

## features: 
### And how these help achieve the above goals:
#### Navigation bar 
   - The simple clapsable navigation Icon provides the user a simple and effective way to navigate to the different pages of the site.
   - The styling is consistant throughout all pages and shows clearly which page the user is currently in as well as the repsonisve colour change that clearly highlights user interaction.
   - The main header/logo of the page is also a clickable link as is common place in many websites across the web.
