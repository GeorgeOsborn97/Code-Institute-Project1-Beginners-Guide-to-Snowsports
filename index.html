            <h3>Is this you?</h3>
            <p>
                Have you ever thought about learining to ski or snowbaord? but were put off by the risk, the cost or the thought that your balance just isnt up to it? Have you seen friends jet off to the Alps and thought how thats something you'd love to try one day? But that day never comes around?
                Are you being quized non stop by your children who saw the magic of the Xgames or Winter Olympics and can't wait to give it a go themselves? But have no idea where to start?
                If you answered yes to any of those questions then you are in the right place.</p>
            <article>
                   <p>I am a qualified Snowboard instructor from the U.K. that has been lucky enough to teach all over the world from Scotland to Japan. And what I found in my career as an instructor is that the same common questions, misconceptions and worries consistantly cropped up.
                My aim here is to try to answer as many of these questions as i can, dispurse any misconceptions and put to bed any worries you may have, so that you can finally get out on the slopes and understand why millions of people all over the world flock to the mountains every year.<br>
                So with this in mind lets jump to the most common misconception and what I belive is peoples number 1 reason for not starting!

                    <li><details ontoggle=""><summary><em>I have poor balance I'll be terrible:</em></summary><strong>THIS IS NOT TRUE!</strong><br>I can not tell you how often I hear this and how often people dont belive me when I tell them it doesnt matter. I am someone who is known for having 2 left feet, I trip myself up more times than I care to mention and yet here i am teaching others to snowboard. Theres a big perception that balance is everything when it comes to skiing and boarding, it isnt. Dont't get me wrong it helps but you can have the worst balance in the world and you will be able to get on a slope. the balance aspect when on a board or on a pair of ski's comes from leg and core strength. the ability to hold a squat is 10x more important then your balance. And take it from me, I've taught hundreds of beginners half of which claimed to have poor balance. Your balance is no where near as bad as you may think!</details></li>
