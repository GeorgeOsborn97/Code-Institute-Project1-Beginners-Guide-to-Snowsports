            <h3>Is this you?</h3>
            <p>
                Have you ever thought about learining to ski or snowbaord? but were put off by the risk, the cost or the thought that your balance just isnt up to it? Have you seen friends jet off to the Alps and thought how thats something you'd love to try one day? But that day never comes around?
                Are you being quized non stop by your children who saw the magic of the Xgames or Winter Olympics and can't wait to give it a go themselves? But have no idea where to start?
                If you answered yes to any of those questions then you are in the right place.</p>

                   <p>I am a qualified Snowboard instructor from the U.K. that has been lucky enough to teach all over the world from Scotland to Japan. And what I found in my career as an instructor is that the same common questions, misconceptions and worries consistantly cropped up.
                My aim here is to try to answer as many of these questions as i can, dispurse any misconceptions and put to bed any worries you may have, so that you can finally get out on the slopes and understand why millions of people all over the world flock to the mountains every year.
