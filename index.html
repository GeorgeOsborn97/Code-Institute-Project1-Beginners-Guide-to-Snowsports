              <p>
                Have you ever thought about learining to ski or snowboard but were put off by the risk? The cost or the steep learning curve? Have you seen friends jet off to the Alps and thought how you would love to join them one day?
                Are you being badgered non stop by your children who saw the Xgames or Winter Olympics and can't wait to give it a go themselves? But have no idea where to start?
                Living in the U.K. it can seem like an up hill battle trying to get started in the world of snowsports. The closest resorts are a flight away, the cost can be extortionate and what if you get there and its not for you?</p>

                    <summary><strong>The Goal</strong></summary>
                    <p>My goal here is to try to help get you started on your journey to the mountains. I am a qualified Snowboard instructor from the U.K. that has been lucky enough to teach all over the world. What I found in my career as an instructor is that the same common questions, misconceptions and worries consistantly cropped up.
                I want to answer as many of these questions as I can, dispurse any misconceptions and put to bed any worries you may have, so that you can finally get out on the slopes and understand why millions of people all over the world flock to the mountains every year.

                <h3>FAQ's and Common Concerns</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><details><summary><em>I have poor balance!</em></summary><strong>THIS DOES NOT MATTER!</strong><br>I can not tell you how often I hear this and how often people don't belive me when I tell them it doesnt matter. I am someone who is known for having 2 left feet, I trip myself up more times than I care to mention and yet here I am teaching others to snowboard. Theres a big perception that balance is everything when it comes to skiing and boarding, it isnt. Dont't get me wrong it helps but you can have the worst balance in the world and you will be able to get on a slope. the balance aspect when on a board or on a pair of ski's comes from leg and core strength. The ability to hold a squat is 10x more important then your balance. And take it from me, I've taught hundreds of beginners half of which claimed to have poor balance. Your balance is no where near as bad as you may think!</details></li>  
                    <li><details><summary><em>I'd just fall over and get hurt!</em></summary>As a follow on from the last point, this is typically the next thing people say, and is often many peoples biggest concern. Hence why I want to address this one early.<br><strong>Yes you will fall over.</strong> Even the best instructor in the world will not keep you on your feet forever. However every instructors goal is to teach, ensure everyone has a good time and most importantly <strong>keep you safe.</strong> Thats why the very first thing that I teach and that every other instructor I know teaches when faced with a complete beginner is how to fall safely. As I said yes you will fall over, it's ineveitable. But if you listen and do what your instructor tells you the odds of you seriously hurting your self is minimal. Of course there's always a risk but no one is out to get hurt and your safety is everyones top priority.</details></li>
                    <li><details><summary><em>The lifts scare me!/I'm scared of heights!</em></summary>This one is unfortantly more one for you to look at yourself. An instructor can not cure your fear of heights. However I can assure you, if you are someone that has this worry there are many small steps on the mountain that will go a long way to make you more comfortable. Depending on the resort you may not need to go on a chair lift at all. Drag lifts are very common throughout Europe and as beginners they will be more than enough to get around the mountain. <strong>(No beginner is taken straight to the top of the mountain!)</strong> The other thing to do is surround yourself with friends and family. Even if they dont need a lesson and you are worried about being on your own no instructor will turn down a friend or family member that wants to shadow the lesson to make sure you are ok.</details></li>
                    <li><details><summary><em>Don't you just get cold?</em></summary>This one is an understandable question. and the short answer is. <strong>Not Often.</strong> What I mean is skiing and snowboarding is hard work. You will get hot! Hence why you see people out in jumpers and t-shirts however I do not recommend this for beginners as the leading cause of people getting cold is when they get wet, and they get wet when they fall, and as I said earlier you will fall so keep your jackets on! The other big factor is the sun, people assume because you are at altitude in the snow it's going to be cold, but when the suns out the air tempreture rises the heat reflects of the snow and it gets warm! (If you want a tan go skiing!) But with all that in mind please remeber that the weather can change, and when it gets cold... it really does get <strong>cold</strong> so check the forecast every day and keep warm clothes to hand at all times.</details></li>
                    <li><details><summary><em>Isn't it really expensive?</em></summary><strong>No.</strong>(If done in the right way.)<strong>And Yes. It iss very easy for the cost to add up.</strong> Like all holidays the timing of your booking is key, ski resorts ramp up prices heavily when heading towards the start of the season. The best time to book is typically late spring / early summer for the following year and the cheapest dates to book for is early spring. (March-April) Thats because these dates carry risks of poor snow quality and lack of open runs due to lack of snow, so always do your research on resorts and their typical season length. But this risk carries reward especially on the cost front as well as quieter runs which is perfect if you are a beginner. I for one have had some of my best trips in late spring.<br>
                         Other very important costs that need to be considered are lesson and rentals, the best advice I can give for these is shop around. If your hotel / chalet offers rentals and/or lessons which they often do, hold off until you've had a look at other small local businesses. On occasion they can be cheaper and a more likely to offer deals especially for large groups and early bookings. Lastly is the inital kit cost. unlike other holidays this can come with a pretty steep bill however there is a dedictaed page to help break this down so please check that out <a href="what-to-buy.html">here.</a></details></li>
                    <li><details><summary><em>I can already skate/surf will it help? / I can already skate/surf do I need lessons?</em></summary><strong>Yes you will need lessosn!</strong> This question is more often asked by kids than anyone else. So for all those parents that are trying to convincve their kids they really do need lessons this is why. being able to Skate and surf will definatly help. Those sports clearly have a lot of similarities and transfereable skills. However there are some very important differences; How we use edges, the way we transfer weight into and out of turns, how we adapt to different snow conditions, how we approach and adapt to different terrian, be that shallow to steap slopes, powder to groomers, trees to moguls. There is so much to these sports that is unlike any other and lessons are vital for you to not only be safe but also get the most out your time on the hill!</details></li>
                    <li><details><summary><em>I don't know where to start?</em></summary>Finally the most important question, and the one I aim to answer in the most detail. If you head over to the <a href="getting-started.html">"Getting Started"</a> page I will answer this question much more in depth. I'll break down important things to know and consider before and during your first time on the slopes, the different facilities the U.K. has to offer, the pros and cons of dry slopes and indoor slopes, Scotland and all that has to offer, and finally some personal advice and recommendations from myself.</details></li>
