            <h3>Where to begin?</h3>
            <p>
                So the very first thing that needs to be decided before you book a lesson is what are you going to do, ski or snowbaord?
                Now i'm slightly biased in favour of snowbaording but I am aware its not for everyone and theres a few things I would advise you to think about.</p>
                <details>
                    <summary>Things to condider.</summary>
                <ol>
                    <li>Firstly the progression differences. its generally agreed that snowboarding is harder to pick up. the first couple of hours are going to spent getting you stood up and practicing very simple drills. And you will fall over quite abit, unfortuantly thats just a given.<br> Skiing on the otherhand you'll be up and practicing snowplow drills and snowplow turns really rather quickly, you'll gain confidence quickly and really see a lot of progression early on. This alone can sway people towards skiing and its understanable. However as I tell all my students there will come a time when snowboarding clicks, and from then the world is your oyster. skiing is easy to pick up, but hard to master, progress slows down after learning to parrallel turn. with snowboarding its slow to learn but when you figure it out the progress is unbelievable and you'll be flying round the hill. </li>
                
                    <li>Secondly the boots. Snowboard boots are infinatly more comfortable, no skiier will argue with me there, a day in ski boots can be quite taxing on yoyr feet. so if you are going down the ski route. make sure evry time you try boots on you mak eusre they are right. Dont't be polite if theres a problem try another pair, and another and another until you get one that fits like a glove.</li>
                    
                    <li>If you are considering snowboarding, be aware your feet are strapped to a single board. This may seem obvious but i have found that many people in lessons find this quite disconcerting and it takes some getting used. Some people down right can't deal with it and switch to skiing. This is one of those things that you wont know unti you try, but its worth keeping in mind.</li>
                    
                    <li>Lack of poles. A quick note for your future self, snowbaording has no poles. so before you have the confidence to carry your speed well, you may end up stuck on a flat. its more an inconvience than anything but its one that people get surprised by when it happens. So when it does just unstrap, trust me its easier then shuffling!</li>
                </ol>

                <p>So you know what you want to do, now where to go? In the U.K. we don't have the luxury of having the alps within driving distance, but that doesnt mean we have to fork out thousands of pounds just to learn. There are Indoor snowdomes and dry ski slopes all over the U.K. Of course its not the same as actually being in the mountains but for learning the basics and providing a place to keep practicing they are fantastic, so lets look at the pro's and cons of indoor and outdoor slopes here in the U.K.</p>
                <h4>Indoor</h4>
                <p>Indoor slopes are fantastic for beginners, some are better than others but all provide people the ability to get out on the snow, learn and practice.</p>
                <details>
                <summary>Pros:</summary>
                <ul>
                    <li>Its the most realistic slope to learn on if you can't get out to an actual mounatin.</li>
                    <li>unlike dry slopes no matter the weather you can get on the slope!</li>
                    <li>In the larger centers they can create varied terrian in some cases which is a supperb learning tool!</li>
                </ul>
                </details>

                <details>
                <summary>Cons:</summary>
                <ul>
                    <li>Can get very crowded at peak times in lessons and on the slopes in general</li>
                    <li>Late sessions will likley find that theres quite abit of ice on the slope (some indoor slopes are worse for this than others)</li>
                    <li>Very short runs, so unfortanty you'll spend more time going up then coming down</li>
                </ul>
                </details>

                <h4>Dry Slopes</h4>
                <p>Indoor slopes are fantastic for beginners, some are better than others but all provide people the ability to get out on the snow, learn and practice.</p>
                <details>
                <summary>Pros:</summary>
                <ul>
                    <li>Dry slopes are harder to get a good edge grip, therefore by learning on dry slopes when you get to the mountain you will find getting an edge much easier.</li>
                    <li>More often than not dry slopes are quieter then indoor slopes so you wont be worried about getting in other peoples way</li>
                    <li>Dry slopes are often larger with more runs so provide a good variaty of challange</li>
                </ul>
                </details>

                <details>
                <summary>Cons:</summary>
                <ul>
                    <li>You can't trust the british weather, and no one wants to ski in the rain!</li>
                    <li>When you fall dry slopes hurt, they've got better in recent years but many older slopes will leave their mark</li>
                    <li>They are tricky to learn on, they require very good edge control as you can see this is a blessing and a curse</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Scotland</h3>
                <p>I also wanted to take a brief moment to talk about Scotland and what it has to offer. Most of the time when you think skiing you don't think of Scotland, it's fair enough the seasons in the highlands are extreamly unpredictable, but on a good year look no further. From the Cairngorm resort to Glencoe and the Nevis range theres is a bit of everything in Scotland. Do not plan a trip here well in advance the weather can change on a dime, but for a bank holiday trip have a look about a week in advace and make a call. If you get it right you won't regret it. <br> Don't underestimate this little Gem, on a good year it's like having the Alps in your back garden. The conditions are rarely perfect and the skiing can be very tough, we had a saying in Glencoe "if you can ride in Scotland you can ride anywhere" but that's part of the charm.<br> I actually turned down a job in the alps to go back and teach in scotland, I've had some of my best times on a mountain there and will always recommend it!</p>
